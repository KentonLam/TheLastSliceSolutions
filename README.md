# TheLastSlice Solutions 
[TheLastSlice](https://medium.com/windows-developer/deliver-the-famous-bitcoin-pizza-in-this-retro-video-game-challenge-get-a-10-000-tip-3796d6ca5b2f) was an online coding competition/challenge run by Microsoft around June 2018. It was made up of 3 challenges and the first five to solve the third challenge won $10,000 USD.

A brief overfiew of each challenge and my solutions:
 - [Challenge 1](TheLastSliceGame-master) was editing an unwinnable game's code to trigger a win condition.  
 - [Challenge 2](KneadMoreDough-master/KneadMoreDoughSolution) was (in my opinion) the most interesting one. It came down to solving a 3D wordsearch, with letters on each face of a 5x5x5 cube.
 - [Challenge 3](TheLastSlice3) was interacting with a (provided!) Raspberry Pi which came loaded with a minigame similar to challenge 1's game.
